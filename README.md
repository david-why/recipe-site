# Sustenance: Beautiful recipes website

## Technical stuff

The [frontend](./src) is written with Vue.js and Bootstrap. The [backend](./index.ts) is written in pure TypeScript with [Bun](https://bun.com) the goated JavaScript runtime *(typscript support ootb, comes with an http server & postgres driver, how much more can you ask for??)*. The database used is PostgreSQL.

## Selfhosted instructions

It's pretty easy to selfhost this website:

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.com) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) (if not on another database server).
2. Run `bun i` in repo root to install dependencies
3. If needed, create a `.env` file to [configure the PostgreSQL database](https://bun.com/docs/api/sql#postgresql-environment-variables).
4. Set up the database by running `bun scripts/initdb.ts`.
5. Run `bun run build && bun prod` to start the production server.
   1. Run `bun dev` instead to start a local development server.

## AI disclaimer

AI (GitHub Copilot) was used to generate small portions of code, usually phrases or a line, in this project. Most of the code was written myself. The website icon is generated by Google Gemini because I can't draw...
